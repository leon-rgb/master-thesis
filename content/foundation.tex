\chapter{Foundations and Related Work}
\label{chap:ch2}





You need to differentiate between Foundation and related work. Foundation is a method/concept/discipline.. that you are re-using and to understand your thesis, readers need to know about them. However, related work shows why this problem has not been sufficiently solved before.

\section{Foundations}
Here, introduce necessary foundations that is required for understanding your thesis. For example, your research area is on Model-driven software development, and it is necessary for readers to know the concept of model-2-model transformation.
\section{Related work}
In addition to discussing about foundations, you need to discuss about why the problem you are tackling has been insufficiently solved before. To do so, you need to mention related work and discuss what is the difference between your work and those related works.
\subsection{Literature Research Methodology}
It is important that you write how you collected the literature related to your research. Did you use one or more search engine(s)? What were they? What keyword(s) you used? What were the combination of those keywords?
Hitting search button usually yields many results, what were the quality criteria for including or  excluding a paper from your collection?
