Technical Improvements:
Exploring larger parameter models or advanced fine-tuning approaches to enhance both JSON accuracy and semantic similarity.
Developing more robust generalization capabilities to handle a wider range of user requests.
Implementing a more readable format for device data presentation to the model.
For Bosch Smart Home especially further functionality that includes system logs and historical data would be benefital. It would be need to researched what a good aproach is to provide the system logs to a chatbot and how to filter relevant data out of it. Also for historical data it would be necessary to get insights into how the data has to look to answer specific questions. Another point here would be to investigate how and where to store this data.

User Experience Enhancements:

Designing and testing tiered interfaces for different user expertise levels.
Incorporating more visual elements and voice interaction capabilities.
Developing and evaluating features for energy optimization and system behavior insights.

Extended Research:
Conducting larger-scale user studies with more diverse participants and smart home setups.
