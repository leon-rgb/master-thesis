This thesis explores the development and integration of a chatbot system for smart home environments, focusing on enhancing system explainability and user interaction within the Bosch Smart Home ecosystem. As smart home technologies grow increasingly complex, users face challenges in fully understanding and utilizing their capabilities. To address this, we propose a novel approach integrating large language models (LLMs) without extensive fine-tuning to support diverse intents, including device control and data analysis.
The primary objectives of this research are threefold: first, to comprehensively identify the essential components for creating a functional smart home chatbot; second, to push the boundaries of chatbot capabilities by developing and testing a prototype within the Bosch Smart Home app, exploring the feasibility of answering complex questions and managing devices; and third, to enhance system explainability for users, developing features that offer transparent explanations for smart home actions and decisions.
Our methodology involved an iterative development process, combining expert interviews, user surveys, and rigorous evaluation metrics. We implemented a client-server model using Android Studio and Ollama (platform for locally hosting LLMs), demonstrating practical deployment potential., demonstrating practical deployment potential. The evaluation employed a unique combination of semantic similarity and a metric for function calling accuracy to assess chatbot performance across different model iterations.
Results show that our custom ``shllama3instruct'' model achieved the best balance between semantically correct responses and precise function execution. User studies validated the chatbot's positive impact on system explainability and usability, while also highlighting challenges in user preference and efficiency for certain tasks.
This research contributes an architecture blueprint for integrating LLMs into smart home systems and offers insights into potential standardized frameworks for smart home chatbots. It addresses key industry concerns while advancing academic understanding of complex question-answering in smart home contexts. The findings provide valuable direction for future developments in enhancing user experience and system transparency in smart home technologies, benefiting both technical professionals and business stakeholders in the rapidly evolving smart home sector.
