	abstract = {Smart home environments are designed to provide services that help improve the quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators installed throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system. However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate, and therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead users reliant on smart home predictions to wonder “Why did the smart home do that?” In this work, we build on insights from Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and introduce an explainable activity recognition framework in which we leverage leading XAI methods (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Anchors) to generate natural language explanations that explain what about an activity led to the given classification. We evaluate our framework in the context of a commonly targeted smart home scenario: autonomous remote caregiver monitoring for individuals who are living alone or need assistance. Within the context of remote caregiver monitoring, we perform a two-step evaluation: (a) utilize Machine Learning experts to assess the sensibility of explanations and (b) recruit non-experts in two user remote caregiver monitoring scenarios, synchronous and asynchronous, to assess the effectiveness of explanations generated via our framework. Our results show that the XAI approach, SHAP, has a 92\% success rate in generating sensible explanations. Moreover, in 83\% of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart home automation and discuss a range of topics for future work to further improve explainable activity recognition.},

A smart city operates using large numbers of networked sensors to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in near-real time; these data may also have secondary applications. This study proposes one such use of the data gathered by home energy management systems (HEMS). Current HEMS focus mainly on energy efficiency, but residents typically value indoor comfort as well. HEMS collect various types of data that can be used to create an index for short-term indoor comfort called the predicted mean vote (PMV). This study implements a system to identify information within the stored data that is relevant to reducing electricity consumption while maintaining indoor comfort according to each resident’s PMV preference. The system was tested in three households in Japan for 12 days in winter. The system reduced electricity consumption by 5.15\% and increased the comfort satisfaction expressed as PMV by 42.3\%. Qualitative assessments of indoor comfort increased by 16.4\%. Providing users with information selected according to their PMV preferences was more effective in reducing electricity consumption and increasing indoor comfort than providing them with random information.},

As chatbots can perform a variety of tasks, many companies have committed numerous resources to develop and deploy chatbots to enhance various business processes. However, we lack an up-to-date critical review that thoroughly examines both state-of-the-art technologies and innovative applications of chatbots. In this review, we not only critically analyze the various computational approaches used to develop state-of-the-art chatbots, but also thoroughly review the usability and applications of chatbots for various business sectors. We also identify gaps in chatbot-related studies and propose new research directions to address the shortcomings of existing studies and applications. Our review advances both academic research and practical business applications of state-of-the-art chatbots. We provide guidance for practitioners to fully realize the business value of chatbots and assist in making sensible decisions related to the development and deployment of chatbots in various business contexts.

The messages sent using the chatbot is processed using Natural Language processing techniques. Secondly, any device connected to the local area network of the house can control the devices and other appliances in the house. Thirdly, the web application used to enable home automation also has a security feature that only enables certain users to access the application.

It will enable its users to use it free of cost as Facebook messenger app is free in Bangladesh. People can use it from home or any remote location and can control digital home appliances like fans, lights etc. Smart door locking system, face recognition, gas leakage detection, temperature detection and control, humidity detection, fire detection, which has been done through collecting data from different sensors and passing them to Raspberry PI and then PI passes these to the BOT through a REST API, are the additional features that make our security system safer, effective and easier to use compared to other existing approaches.},

Recently, there have been many attempts to allow end-users to teach a home assistant new commands, responses, and rules, which can then be shared with a larger community. However, allowing end-users to teach an agent new responses, which are shared with a large community, opens the gate to malicious users, who can teach the agent inappropriate responses in order to promote their own business, products, or political views. In this paper, we present a platform that enables users to collaboratively teach a smart home assistant (or chatbot) responses using natural language. We present a method of collectively detecting malicious users and using the commands taught by the malicious users to further mitigate activity of future malicious users. We ran an experiment with 192 subjects and show the effectiveness of our platform.},

To address these challenges, we first design and develop an architecture to provide an interactive user interface. Secondly, we propose a machine learning approach based on intent classification and natural language understanding to understand user intents and generate SPARQL queries. We especially process a new social network dataset (i.e., myPersonality) and add it to the existing knowledge bases to extend the chatbot capabilities by understanding analytical queries. The system can be extended with a new domain on-demand, flexible, multiple knowledge base, multilingual, and allows intuitive creation and execution of different tasks for an extensive range of topics. Furthermore, evaluation and application cases in the chatbot are provided to show how it facilitates interactive semantic data towards different real application scenarios and showcase the proposed approach for a knowledge graph and data-driven chatbot.},

A chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) is central to the proposed feedback mechanism. NLP is used to transform text-based plain language input, both human-written and machine-generated, into a form that the framework can use to generate a workflow for execution in an environment of interest. The example environment described here is containerized network management, in which the workflow management framework, using feedback, can detect anomalies and mitigate potential incidents.},

	abstract = {The idea of utilizing computers for question answering tasks has been around from the early beginning of these systems. First algorithms with the aim to accomplish this were already implemented in the early 1960s. In recent years, chatbots have been gaining enormous popularity in various fields. In the context of business applications, they are considered as useful tools for improving customer relationships. In this paper, chat conversations between customers and the chatbot of a telecommunication company are analysed to find out if these interactions can be used to determine a) users' topics of interests and b) user satisfaction. To reach this goal, chat conversations are interpreted as sequences of events and user inputs are analysed with the help of text mining techniques. The study shows that based on users' written conversational contributions, valuable insights on users' interests and satisfaction can be gained. The majority of users leave the chat conversation after a short period of time if the chatbot was not able to give the desired answer right away. Moreover, a huge number of conversations deal with similar topics. Our results imply that companies offering chatbots must thoroughly analyse the collected data to gain more insights into their customers' needs. Based on our findings, they can improve customers' satisfaction by offering personalized service and implementing real-time feedback.},
